# IST_LP-unit-tests-2024
Logic for Programming - Unit tests for the project

### Brief
Unit tests provided in the project statement, but now in code. <br/>
Still in development, so:
- There may be mistakes       (feel free to report them).
- Further updates are coming.
- Further updates are welcome (feel free to contribute).
<br/>

### How to use
1. Chose the tests to run (in `tests.pl`)
1. `swipl -q -l target.pl -t run_tests tests.pl`
2. The last printed test is the last successful one, <br> 
so infer your progress from there.

### Sample output
```bash
[Success] Test 4.
[Success] Test 5.
[Success] Test 6.
[Success] Test 7.
[Success] Test 8.
[Success] Test 9 ('task failed successfully')
